# Pre - prerequisite test
## Pre0
In this task you do not need to worry much about the performance. The most straightforward
implementation that you can imagine should be fast enough to meet the time limits.
No specific techniques are required and you are not expected to use any form of parallelism yet;
any solution that works correctly is fine.
