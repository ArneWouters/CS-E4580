# MF - Median Filter
## MF1
Implement a simple **sequential** baseline solution. Make sure it works correctly.
Do not try to use any form of parallelism yet. You are expected to use a naive algorithm that
computes the median separately for each pixel, with a **linear-time median-finding algorithm**.
